-- Orbs a find spills when a fog cell opens (artifact-contract orbs.ts).

-- A spill names its find by the public sha only, like a claim. It holds how
-- many orbs fell and when they are gone, never who spilled them, where, or
-- when anyone played. A find spills once a week; the row stays until its
-- week is two weeks old so it cannot spill again, and is answered only while
-- it lives.
