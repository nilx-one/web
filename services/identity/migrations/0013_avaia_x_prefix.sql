-- An Avaia address is its owner's pub_dress without the leading `0`:
-- `0x0sky` owns `x0skai`, no longer `0skai`. Stored addresses predate that
-- shape and gain the literal `x`; every referencing column follows through
-- ON UPDATE CASCADE.

-- This is a format change, not an owner's rename, so the trigger that marks a
-- renamed Avaia configured must not see it. Repository code re-applies
-- 0007_avaia_configuration.sql in the same transaction, which recreates it.
